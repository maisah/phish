CAS Phishing Scam
======================

This repo is used for a project in CS242.

The scam is to encourage users to login into the cloned *cas.arcadia.edu*. We have created a fake domain called *cas-arcadia.eu*
with the hopes that people will not notice it is different from the orginial. Once pressing 'Sign in', users will be taken to 
fooled.html where they are told that the website they justed logged into is not the real CAS and are warned to look out for 
similar scams in the future.

When doing this project, we did not log any credentials because that is illegal and we do not want to get into trouble.
